# file contains turn history of interesting game without strict rules
# in regards to castling (western chess uses rule to prevent castling when
# king would move into checkmate, I frankly didn't care at that time)
# The game was played by me vs me while testing en passant, but
# turned out to be an interesting example game to replay were black wins with
# en passant and turns whites queenside castling into a nightmare.
