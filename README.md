# Chess (-student) implemented using pygame

This project will be used to train a model using deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) based on opponents play.  
Nevertheless, the game can be played in multi-player mode without fancy ML features.

The project will eventually contain the following features (ticked ones implemented)
- [ ] complete chess game
- [ ] history log and game loading

- [ ] deep learning reinforced model
- [ ] trained example model
- [ ] payable against trained model
- [ ] can train own model based on **your** moves!


### Usage:
clone the project
```shell
git clone git@github.com:philsupertramp/chess
```

Install requirements
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game in 2P mode
```shell
python main.py
```

## Development

clone the repository and install the dependencies as described before.

### Note:
- Do not, and I repeat **not** use Pawn-d4 as a first step for testing. **This pawn is on the (4,4)-tile and will always work!**
